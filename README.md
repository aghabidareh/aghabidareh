🚀 Machine Learning Enthusiast | Aspiring Backend Developer

I navigate the world of Machine Learning, but my curiosity pulls me toward Django and backend development. While I currently train models and crunch data, I’m also building my expertise in crafting robust backend systems.

🔥 What Drives Me?
Architecting intelligent systems that learn, adapt, and evolve.
Exploring the depths of Django to power scalable applications.
Seeking collaborations with Microsoft, FAANG, and forward-thinking teams.
🛠️ Currently...
Learning Django, refining my backend skills.
Pushing the boundaries of AI and deep learning.
📖 Fun Side Quest
When I'm not coding, I'm lost in the philosophy of Dostoevsky and Camus, questioning existence between lines of code.
